1.write a prgm to call 2 methods from main class
2.wrie a prgm to create a.main method b.punch method c.kick method 
(note:main method calls punch methd and punch method calls kick method)

1.prgm to create static and non static method and call it from main method
2.prgm for 2 non static methoods and call from main method
assignment
2.prgm to create main method and 2 static methods,main calls 1st static and 1st static calls 2nd
3.prgm to create main method and 2 non static methods,main calls 1st non static and 1s non static will call 2nd
4.prgm to create main method,static and non static method,main calls static and static calls non static method

sm->static method; nsm->non static method 
sm->sm(call directly)
nsm->nsm(call directly)
nsm->sm(call directly)
sm->nsm(dosent call directly)uses object
*
->all the local variables must be initialized before using
*
variables
->local

    ->static
    ->non static
1.prgm to create static variable and print it in main method
2.prgm to create non static variable and print it in main method

sm->static method; nsm->non static method; sv->static variable; nsm->non static variable  
sm->sm+sv(call directly)

nsm->sm+sv(call directly)
sm->nsm+nsv(dosent call directly)uses object
3.a prgm to create static and non static varible and print it in main method
*
0 is default value not garbage value which compiler calls
datatype->default val(static/non-static)
byte
short
int->0
long
char
float
double
boolean
string
*
assignment
in global initialization is not mandatory,if not initialized by developer then compiler does it by default
1.prgm to print default value of all datatypes

method overloading:having same function names with diff args 

16/7/20
assignment
1.overload static and non static method
2.overload main method(interview qsn)
3.to perform multiplication in 4 different ways

17/7/20
assignment
1.create static variable, non static variable, local variable and print all methods in main method and draw execution diagram

18/7/20
assignment
1.to create 2 static variables,2 non-static variables and print in main method and draw execution diagram
